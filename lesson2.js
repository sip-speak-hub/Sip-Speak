    story: "I used to hate horror movies. Like, genuinely couldn't sleep after watching one. But last year, my friend convinced me to watch Get Out. I went in expecting cheap scares, but what I got was so much more. It was a psychological thriller wrapped in social commentary, with brilliant cinematography and a plot twist I never saw coming. \n\nThe character development was subtle but powerful. The pacing kept me on the edge of my seat without relying on jump scares. And the ending? A masterclass in storytelling. Now I'm hooked on psychological thrillers. Turns out, I don't hate horror—I just hate poorly made horror. That film had serious rewatch value, and every time I watch it, it hits different. It's an underrated gem in my book, even though it won an Oscar.",
