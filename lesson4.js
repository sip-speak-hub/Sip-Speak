    story: "Six months ago, I hit a wall. I was working 60-hour weeks, surviving on coffee and willpower, and sleeping maybe 5 hours a night. I thought I was being productive, but really, I was just burning out.\n\nThe signs were there - constant fatigue, irritability, getting sick every other week. My cortisol levels were through the roof. But I ignored them until I couldn't anymore. I had a complete meltdown during a presentation. Right there in front of 30 colleagues, I froze, started shaking, and couldn't continue.\n\nThat was my wake-up call. I realized my sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation, and chronic stress were destroying my health. So I made lifestyle changes. Small ones at first - a 10-minute walk during lunch, turning off screens an hour before bed, taking actual breaks instead of eating at my desk.\n\nI started practicing mindfulness - just 5 minutes of meditation each morning. I learned about the mind-body connection, how stress triggers the fight-or-flight response, how quality sleep strengthens the immune system. I discovered that 10,000 steps a day isn't magic - consistency matters more than perfection.\n\nNow, six months later, I still have stress, but I manage it differently. I prioritize work-life balance, I have a self-care routine, and I actually enjoy my me-time. My mental resilience has improved dramatically. The irony? I'm more productive now working 40 hours than I ever was working 60.",
